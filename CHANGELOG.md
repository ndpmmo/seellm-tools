# Changelog - SeeLLM Tools

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Accounts quota visibility (`#accounts`)**:
  - Fixed usage rendering condition to include `quota_json` (previously only checked `discovered_limit`/`quotas_json`, causing false `Unknown`).
  - Merged usage data from multiple sources on load:
    - D1 managed accounts (`/api/d1/inspect/accounts`)
    - D1 connections (`/api/d1/inspect/connections`)
    - local vault accounts (`/api/vault/accounts`)
  - Added robust quota parser for both array/object payload formats and normalized `% remaining` display in the Usage column.
- **TypeScript build stability**:
  - Extended live screenshot type to include optional `email`/`ts` fields so dashboard live view compiles cleanly.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Tools → Gateway toggle propagation**:
  - Updated Smart Sync trigger call to include `x-sync-secret` when Tools notifies Gateway after toggling account `is_active`.
  - This fixes the case where toggle from `http://localhost:4000/#accounts` changed D1 state but Gateway `providers/codex#connections` did not refresh immediately.
- **Trigger safety diagnostics**:
  - Added explicit warning log when `gatewayUrl` exists but `d1SyncSecret` is missing, so skipped trigger calls are visible in server logs.

### Changed
- **Smart Sync request contract**:
  - `POST /api/sync/trigger` from Tools now uses secret-auth headers instead of anonymous JSON-only POST calls.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Smart Sync Trigger**: Implemented a local webhook trigger system. When toggling an account's status in Tools, it now sends an immediate notification to the Gateway over the local network to trigger an on-demand pull, reducing sync latency to near-zero.

### Fixed
- **Direct D1 Sync**: Switched the account toggle mechanism to use a direct Worker PATCH endpoint instead of the standard synchronization pipeline. This bypasses version-based conflict checks on Cloudflare D1, ensuring status changes are always applied immediately.
- **Sync Resilience**: Improved error handling and fallback logic in the D1 Proxy and SyncManager services.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-09


### Added
- **Camofox Documentation**: Integrated custom documentation for Camofox browser integration.
- **CamofoxDocsView**: New UI component to display specialized browser documentation.

### Fixed
- **Account Synchronization Logic**:
  - Refactored `SyncManager.js` to ensure `is_active` status is correctly propagated to Cloudflare D1 for both `vault_accounts` and `codex_connections`.
  - Removed dependency on account status when determining connectivity state, allowing accounts to be toggled off even if in "idle" or other states.
  - Forced immediate synchronization (bypassing debounce) when toggling account status from the UI.
- **UI Consistency**:
  - Improved `AccountsView.tsx` and `VaultAccountsView.tsx` to handle `undefined` or legacy `is_active` states, defaulting to active (1).
  - Added visual feedback (strikethrough and opacity) for disabled accounts in the dashboard.
  - Standardized toggle component behavior across different views.
- **Performance**: Improved `server.js` proxying logic to handle Cloudflare D1 requests more robustly with better timeout handling.

### Changed
- **Vault Schema**: Updated local database handling to support synchronization of activation states and metadata.
- **Dashboard Layout**: Refined layout of various views for better readability and a more premium aesthetic.
